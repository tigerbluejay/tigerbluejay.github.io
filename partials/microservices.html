                Microservices Sample Architectural Decisions
              </p>

              <p>Explain and justify the architectural decisions behind a modern .NET microservices platform, focusing on how the chosen patterns support scalability, maintainability, and team autonomy over time. In particular, discuss why you opted for Vertical Slice Architecture instead of a traditional layered approach, how CQRS and MediatR fit into this design, and how these choices affect coupling, testability, and future growth. Address potential concerns about over-engineering, and explain how your API design (including Minimal APIs and any supporting libraries) balances simplicity with long-term extensibility.</p>

                Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design
              </p>

              <p>Explain why Clean Architecture is a good choice for microservices that contain complex business logic. In your answer, describe how Clean Architecture helps protect the core domain from external concerns such as databases, frameworks, and user interfaces. Compare data-centric microservices with behavior-centric ones, and explain why Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is particularly well suited for domains with rich business rules, state transitions, and invariants. Finally, describe how the Domain Layer in Clean Architecture supports DDD concepts such as aggregates and entities, and explain how this layered approach aligns with the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).</p>

              <p>Explain how asynchronous, event-driven communication can be used to decouple microservices in a distributed system. In your answer, describe the role of a message broker and the Publish/Subscribe pattern in enabling indirect communication between services.
